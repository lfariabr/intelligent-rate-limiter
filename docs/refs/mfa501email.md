**Subject**: Thanks for an Awesome 12 Weeks!

Hi Dr. James,

I just wanted to express my sincere appreciation for these past 12 weeks.
Your classes were truly awesome! I genuinely learned a lot and really enjoyed the journey.

As I’ll have some free time now, I’d love any recommendations you might have: articles, books, guides, or anything you consider valuable for deepening my understanding of mathematical foundations, probability, or AI. 
I’m keen to keep building on what we learned!!!

Also… based on your experience reviewing our assessments, is there anyone in the class you think I should connect with for exchanging ideas or discussing future topics? 
I value collaboration and would appreciate your insight.

Looking forward to hearing from you, and thank you again for everything this term!

Kind regards,
Luis
