Hi Dr. Omid,

I just wanted to express my sincere appreciation for these past 12 weeks.
Your classes were genuinely inspiring, and I really enjoyed the way the subject connected theory, ethics, and real-world application. I learned a lot and truly appreciated the journey!

As I’ll have some free time now, I’d love any recommendations you might have (articles, books, researchers, or frameworks) that you consider valuable for deepening my understanding of HCD, AI governance, and the ethical dimensions of emerging technologies. I’m keen to keep building on everything we explored this term!

Also, based on your experience reviewing everyone’s assessments, is there anyone in the class you think I should connect with for idea exchange or future discussions?
I value collaboration and would really appreciate your insight.

Thank you again for the fantastic term, and I hope to continue learning from your guidance in future subjects.

Kind regards,
Luis
